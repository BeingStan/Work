funnel..combine with same datatype
transformer- make changes from source to target -arthmetic ops etc
two comma together- null
null value in a row makes that row rejected
to fix the above problem reject mode = o/p from source

timestamp to date conversion in tranformer
timestamp to date or date to timestamp


date format in  DS yyyy/mm/dd


use union instead of funnel -no repeats there



for single table- sort and remove duplicate
for multiple tables- 






by default it's inner join in joins in DS
but if two tables don't have same column name, it won't work at all

non equi join or self join isnt possible, only possible with look up


merge allows matched and unmatched op too, join has only one op, but columns should match

for unmatched columns, use lookup
e.mgr=m.empno

change capture compares two columns and has a column called change code with 3 columns
0 for copy
1 for insert
2 for deletion
3 for update
here, first file is master file
based on change code, we can perform ops
drop column for insert= true
explct and all values

group function is done using aggregator in DS


we can aggrgt without aggregator, by using transformer


we can have same file as source and also as the target 

change apply modifies tgt file based on before and after data. only the after data is captured inside







convert one row/columns to multiple rows/columns is called pivoting
horizontal - column into rows



by default, datatype of stage variable is CHAR and size is 1


surrogate key(temp primary key) is used in type2 
in type 1 empno is primary key


seq isn't dropped when table is dropped 
indexes,constraints are also droppeed
seq, procedures become invalid
surrogate key isn't dropped as well

the number we take in the file in SKG is the initial value amd it increments from there onwards


--slowly changing dimensions




full history type 2
partial history type 3
no history type 1



9 types in DS
